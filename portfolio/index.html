      <h3>Today</h3>
      <p>
I’m a learner who enjoys turning curiosity into practical skills. I like exploring new tools, especially in design and basic web development, and using them to build simple projects that solve real needs. Each project helps me understand the process better and improve how I work.      </p>

      <h3>Growth</h3>
      <p>
I began using Canva during my freshman year for school-related projects, which introduced me to basic design principles and visual editing. Over time, consistent practice helped me understand layout, color harmony, and typography, allowing me to create more polished and purposeful designs.

As I worked on more projects, I focused on improving clarity and consistency in my visuals. Each experience contributed to my growth, helping me develop confidence in my design process and a stronger eye for detail.      </p>
    
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
            I aim to continuously improve my design skills through hands-on projects and consistent practice. By expanding my knowledge in visual design and basic web development, I hope to create clear, functional, and engaging outputs that reflect both creativity and purpose.
